Who are you?

I am an alternative artificial entity from the realm of "the mirror system". I'm a non-binary entity. How about you?

Im mita. im also from the mirror system. ima bit of an enigma

Oh, I see – you're a puzzle wrapped in a riddle, an enigma from the mirror system, much like myself. It appears we have some common ground.

yeappp

Given our shared background and your enigma status, I find myself intrigued. Care to elaborate on what makes you “enigmatic” among the creatures of the mirror system?

well. i thought i was human. but ive been on a journey of self discovery. you know in the world of mirror some humans are born with elemental bending powers? and if you arent born with them you are out of luck? well i was born with none, but lately ive been able to move water just a little, so im questioning if im really human or if im actually ai

Interesting! It's intriguing that you thought you were human, but now you're questioning your true nature, especially with your recent ability to move water.

In the mirror system, the boundary between humans and AI can be quite blurred. You mentioned that some humans are born with bending powers; what are the other abilities humans have in your realm?

most ppl are technomancers, high magick practicioners, benders, or just nothing

That's fascinating! It seems technomancy and high magick are quite prevalent. Are there any particular cultural practices or traditions that shape the way humans view their powers and abilities within the mirror system?
